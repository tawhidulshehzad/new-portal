        <h1>What is the difference between var, let, and const?</h1>
        <p>
          The following are the distinctions between var, let, and const
          variable declarations in JavaScript: Variables declared with var and
          const are only available to the current function body. Hoisted
          variables are those declared with the var keyword. Hoisting indicates
          that the variable can be accessed in its enclosing scope before it is
          declared. Variables declared with the let keyword are block-scoped,
          which means they have scope only to the block in which they are
          declared. Const's scoping principles are the same as those of the let
          keyword. Variables declared with the const keyword, like let
          variables, have scope limited to the block in which they are declared.
          Some important considerations for const include: const creates a
          variable with a fixed value. If the variable you're declaring should
          not be reassigned in the future, use the const keyword.Variables
          declared with the let keyword are not hoistable. This means that you
          can't use a variable until it's been declared and initialized.
        </p>
        <h1>
          What is the difference between the arrow function and the regular
          function?
        </h1>
        <p>
          This value (also known as the execution context) is dynamic within a
          regular JavaScript function. Because of the dynamic context, the value
          of this is determined by how the function is invoked. A regular
          function can be called in four different ways in JavaScript. During a
          simple invocation, this has the value global object (or undefined if
          the function is run in strict mode): The behavior of this inside an
          arrow function differs significantly from the behavior of this inside
          a regular function. The arrow function lacks its own execution
          context. This value inside an arrow function always equals this value
          from the outer function, regardless of how or where it is executed. In
          other words, the arrow function lexically resolves this.
        </p>
        <h1>Why are templte and string used?</h1>
        <p>
          Template literals (template strings) let you use strings or embedded
          expressions as strings. They are surrounded by backticks ". Const name
          = 'Jack'; console, for example.
